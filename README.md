# Real-SQL-Interview-questions
While preparing for Product/Data Analyst interviews, I couldn't find any real SQL queries that are asked, so here it is.

I will keep adding the questions here and link the solutions in the repository.

## 1 Product Analyst interview

1. Get the day wise D1 and D7 retention rate for last 30 days for a given date

Table available:

date   user_id
01-02    a
01-02    b
02-02    c
..
..

Output:

18-07(D0)  50%   30%
19-07(D0)  40%   20%
